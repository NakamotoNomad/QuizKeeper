# Quiz Keeper

This is the final project for the Alchemy University Ethereum bootcamp.

**This is a tech demo and not an actual product.**

The idea for this app is to learn Web3 security (though the basic concept could be used for many different fields).
Once you've gone through the course you'll be presented with a quiz.
If you pass the quiz you get an NFT as a certificate.
What makes this project different is that you need to keep up with the newest developments in the field to be able to keep the NFT.
Once a month you get a mini course with all the newest exploits and hacks.
Once you've gone through the new content you have to pass another quiz to be able to keep your NFT.
If you don't stay up to date your NFT will be burned from your wallet.

Also contains some extras like a soulbound NFT for achievements like having a 6-month streak which you keep forever and doesn't get burned.
